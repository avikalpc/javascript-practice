                    <h3>&copy;CAPPUCCINO</h3>
                    <p class="text-light bg-dark">A cappuccino is an espresso-based coffee drink that originated in Italy and is traditionally prepared with steamed milk foam Variations of the drink involve the use of cream instead of milk, using non-dairy milk substitutes and flavoring with cinnamon or chocolate powder.[2][3] It is typically smaller in volume than a caffè latte, with a thicker layer of microfoam.
                        The name comes from the Capuchin friars, referring to the colour of their habits,[5] and in this context referring to the colour of the beverage when milk is added in small portion to dark, brewed coffee[6] (today mostly espresso). The physical appearance of a modern cappuccino with espresso créma and steamed milk is a result of a long evolution of the drink.</p>

                 <h3>&copy;ESPRESSO</h3>
                 <p class="text-light bg-dark">
                    Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, 
                    with a viscosity similar to that of warm honey. This is due to the higher concentration of
                    suspended and dissolved solids, and the crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency).[2]
                    As a result of the pressurized brewing process, the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of
                    espresso are very concentrated. Espresso has more caffeine per unit volume than most coffee beverages,
                    but because its usual serving size is much smaller than (for example) drip-brewed coffee the
                     caffeine content of a single serving of espresso is generally lower than that of a mug of drip coffee.

                            Like café latte, caffè mocha is based on espresso and
                            hot milk but with added chocolate flavouring and sweetener, 
                            typically in the form of cocoa powder and sugar. 
                            Many varieties use chocolate syrup instead, 
                            and some may contain dark or milk chocolate.
